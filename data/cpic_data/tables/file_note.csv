While CPIC recommends to directly test the causal SNP if possible, in cases where only c.1236G>A is tested or results are available for, it should be clearly stated in the test report that ""decreased function"" was inferred by detecting the exonic tag SNP, and disclose that in rare cases, the causal decreased function variant c.1129-5923C>G may not be present despite having this tag SNP.",4,1
