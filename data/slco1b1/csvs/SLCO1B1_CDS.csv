Gene: SLCO1B1,,,,
SLCO1B1 Phenotype,Activity Score,EHR Priority Result Notation,Consultation (Interpretation) Text Provided with Test Result,Example Diplotypes
SLCO1B1 Decreased Function,n/a,Abnormal/Priority/High Risk,"This result signifies that the patient has one copy of a normal function allele (*_) and one copy of a no function allele (*_). Based on the genotype result, this patient is predicted to have decreased SLCO1B1 function. This patient may be at risk for an adverse response to medications that are affected by SLCO1B1. To avoid an untoward drug response, dose adjustments may be necessary for medications affected by SLCO1B1 (i.e. statins). Please consult a clinical pharmacist for more specific information about how SLCO1B1 function influences drug dosing.","*1/*5, *1/*15, "
SLCO1B1 Increased Function,n/a,Normal/Routine/Low Risk,"This result signifies that the patient has two copies of an increased function allele. Based on the genotype result, this patient is predicted to have increased SLCO1B1 function. This means that there is no reason to adjust the dose of most medications that are affected by SLCO1B1 on the basis of SLCO1B1 genetic status at this time. Please consult a clinical pharmacist for more specific information about how SLCO1B1 function influences drug dosing.",*14/*14 
SLCO1B1 Indeterminate,n/a,none,This result signifies that the patient has an allele combination with unknown or uncertain function alleles. The expected phenotype for this patient cannot be determined currently based on the SLCO1B1 diplotype result. Please consult a clinical pharmacist for more specific information about how SLCO1B1 function influences drug dosing.,"*1/*7, *1/*10, *7/*10 "
SLCO1B1 Normal Function,n/a,Normal/Routine/Low Risk,"This result signifies that the patient has two copies of a normal function allele. Based on the genotype result, this patient is predicted to have normal SLCO1B1 function. This means that there is no reason to adjust the dose of most medications that are affected by SLCO1B1 on the basis of SLCO1B1 genetic status. Please consult a clinical pharmacist for more specific information about how SLCO1B1 function influences drug dosing.","*1/*1, *1/*14 "
SLCO1B1 Poor Function,n/a,Abnormal/Priority/High Risk,"This result signifies that the patient has two copies of a no function allele. Based on the genotype result, this patient is predicted to have low SLCO1B1 function. This patient may be at a high risk for an adverse response to medications that are affected by SLCO1B1 (i.e. statins). To avoid an untoward drug response, dose adjustments or alternative therapeutic agents may be necessary for medications affected by SLCO1B1. Please consult a clinical pharmacist for more specific information about how SLCO1B1 function influences drug dosing.","*5/*5, *5/*15, *15/*15 "
SLCO1B1 Possible Decreased Function,n/a,Abnormal/Priority/High Risk,"This result signifies that the patient has one copy of a uncertain or unknown function allele (*_) and one copy of a no function allele (*_). Based on the genotype result, this patient is predicted to have possible decreased SLCO1B1 function. This patient may be at risk for an adverse response to medications that are affected by SLCO1B1. To avoid an untoward drug response, dose adjustments may be necessary for medications affected by SLCO1B1 (i.e. statins). Please consult a clinical pharmacist for more specific information about how SLCO1B1 function influences drug dosing.","*5/*6, *15/*10, *5/*43 "
