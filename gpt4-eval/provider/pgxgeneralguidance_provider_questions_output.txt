Question: How useful is SLCO1B1 testing? Is there evidence, with publications, that shows statin dosing alterations or changing therapy after genetic testing have led to reduced risk of statin induced myopathy?

Answer: SLCO1B1 testing can be useful in predicting the risk of statin-induced myopathy. The SLCO1B1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the uptake of statins into the liver, the primary site of statin metabolism. Variations in this gene can affect the body's ability to process statins and thus influence the risk of side effects such as myopathy.

Several studies have shown an association between SLCO1B1 variants and the risk of statin-induced side effects. For instance, a study by Voora et al. found that the SLCO1B1*5 genetic variant is associated with statin-induced side effects {"Sources": "J Am Coll Cardiol  54, 1609-16 (2009)"}. Another study by Khine et al. found a similar association in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia {"Sources": "Am Heart J  179, 1-9 (2016)"}.

Furthermore, a proof-of-concept study by Carr et al. found that the SLCO1B1 genetic variant was associated with statin-induced myopathy, supporting the potential utility of pharmacogenetic testing in this context {"Sources": "Clin Pharmacol Ther  94, 695-701 (2013)"}.

However, it's important to note that while these studies suggest a potential role for SLCO1B1 testing in managing statin therapy, more research is needed to fully understand the clinical utility of such testing. It's also important to consider other factors that can influence statin response, such as drug interactions, patient characteristics, and treatment goals. Therefore, any decisions about statin therapy should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.

Question: Are there PGx guidelines for statins?

Answer: Yes, there are pharmacogenetic (PGx) guidelines for statins. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) has issued guidelines for SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 genotypes and statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms. These guidelines provide therapeutic recommendations based on the patient's genotype to help clinicians make informed decisions about statin therapy. 

For instance, the guidelines suggest that statin therapy should neither be discontinued nor avoided based on SLCO1B1, ABCG2, or CYP2C9 genotype results for patients with an indication for statin therapy, especially if the statin therapy is based on shared decision making between patient and provider. 

The guidelines also provide specific recommendations for different statins based on the patient's genotype. For example, for patients with certain SLCO1B1 and ABCG2 phenotypes, the guidelines provide specific recommendations for rosuvastatin therapy. Similarly, for patients with certain SLCO1B1 and CYP2C9 phenotypes, the guidelines provide specific recommendations for fluvastatin therapy.

However, it's important to note that these guidelines are intended to assist clinicians in decision making and are not a substitute for professional medical advice. The ultimate responsibility for patient care resides with the healthcare provider.

Question: What pharmacogenetic test should I order for my patient to reduce muscle toxicity risk? Which pharmacogenetic tests or panels are recommended to assess the risk of muscle toxicity?

Answer: Pharmacogenetic testing can be useful in assessing the risk of muscle toxicity in patients treated with statins. The genes of interest for this purpose are SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9. 

SLCO1B1 encodes a protein involved in drug transport into the liver, and certain variants in this gene have been associated with an increased risk of statin-induced muscle toxicity. ABCG2 is another transporter gene that can affect statin pharmacokinetics and potentially contribute to muscle toxicity. CYP2C9 is involved in the metabolism of certain statins and can also influence the risk of adverse effects.

It's important to note that the decision to order a pharmacogenetic test should be based on various factors, including the patient's clinical history, the type of statin being considered, and the potential for drug-drug interactions. Furthermore, the results of these tests should be interpreted in the context of the patient's overall clinical picture.

Pharmacogenetic results, an interpreted phenotype, and a concise interpretation or summary of the result must be documented in the EHR (74, 75). To incorporate a phenotype in the EHR in a standardized manner, genotype test results provided by the laboratory must be consistently translated into an interpreted phenotype (Table 1, main manuscript).

Question: Should I order a PGx test before I prescribe simvastatin?

Answer: Pharmacogenetic testing can provide useful information before prescribing simvastatin. The SLCO1B1 genetic status may be predictive of the risk of simvastatin-induced myopathy due to altered drug exposure. However, the decision to order a pharmacogenetic test should be made in consultation with a clinical pharmacist or other healthcare professional, considering all relevant factors including treatment goals, patient characteristics, and potential drug interactions. {"Sources": "CPIC Clinical Guidelines for Statins and SLCO1B1, ABCG2 and CYP2C9"}

Question: Which genes are considered beneficial in guiding the overall prescription of statins?

Answer: The genes SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 are considered beneficial in guiding the overall prescription of statins. These genes are associated with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of statins, which are commonly prescribed medications for reducing cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease. Variations in these genes can influence the body's response to statins, including the risk of statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMS), which can impact statin adherence and the long-term effectiveness of statin therapy. 

SLCO1B1 is associated with all statins, ABCG2 is associated with rosuvastatin, and CYP2C9 is associated with fluvastatin. Genetic testing for these genes may help identify patients at significant risk of SAMS, potentially leading to recommendations for a lower statin dose or an alternative statin with lower SAMS risk. However, it's important to note that statin therapy should not be discontinued or avoided based on these genotype results alone, especially if the statin therapy is based on shared decision-making between patient and provider.

Question: My patient has significant CVD risk and requires statins to manage her high cholesterol levels. What kind of PGx tests should I order to manage her statins?

Answer: Pharmacogenetic testing for SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 genotypes can provide useful information for managing statin therapy. These tests can help identify patients who may be at an increased risk for statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMS), which can affect statin tolerance and adherence. 

SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 genotypes can influence the pharmacokinetics of certain statins and thus the risk of SAMS. For example, certain variants in the SLCO1B1 gene can lead to increased plasma concentrations of statins, which can increase the risk of SAMS. Similarly, certain ABCG2 and CYP2C9 genotypes can also affect statin plasma concentrations and the risk of SAMS.

However, it's important to note that the decision to initiate statin therapy should not solely be based on these genotypes. Other factors such as the patient's cardiovascular disease risk, the balance of SAMS risk versus known cardiovascular disease benefit, and shared decision making between patient and provider should also be considered. 

Please consult with a clinical pharmacist or a healthcare provider with expertise in pharmacogenetics for more specific guidance.

Question: What are the general recommendations for statin use in patients identified with poor or decreased function based on their SLCO1B1  genotype?

Answer: Patients with certain SLCO1B1 genotypes may have decreased function of the SLCO1B1 protein, which can affect how they metabolize certain drugs, including statins. Statins are commonly used to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. 

In general, patients with decreased function of the SLCO1B1 protein may have an increased risk of statin-induced myopathy, particularly with high-dose statin therapy. Therefore, healthcare providers may consider using a lower dose of statin, using a different statin that is not significantly affected by the SLCO1B1 protein, or monitoring the patient more closely for signs of muscle toxicity.

However, it's important to note that these are general recommendations and the decision to prescribe a statin, and which one, should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's overall health, other medications they are taking, and their specific treatment goals. 

Please consult with a healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.

Question: Do the ABCG2 and SLCO1B1 genes interact to influence statin therapy? Are there specific considerations for adjusting statin prescriptions based on the variants in one or  both of these genes?

Answer: Yes, the ABCG2 and SLCO1B1 genes can interact to influence statin therapy. Both of these genes encode for transporters that play a role in the absorption and disposition of certain statins. Variants in these genes can alter the function of these transporters, potentially affecting the systemic exposure to statins and the risk of statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMS).

For example, the ABCG2 gene encodes an efflux transporter (BCRP) that modulates the absorption and disposition of rosuvastatin. A variant in this gene, rs2231142, can lead to decreased function or poor function of this transporter, potentially increasing the risk of rosuvastatin-induced myopathy.

Similarly, the SLCO1B1 gene encodes a transporter (OATP1B1) that facilitates the hepatic uptake of all statins. Variants in this gene can lead to decreased or poor function of this transporter, potentially increasing the systemic exposure to statins and the risk of SAMS.

When prescribing statins, it may be beneficial to consider the patient's ABCG2 and SLCO1B1 genotypes. For instance, if a patient is predicted to have decreased or poor function in either or both of these genes, they may be at an increased risk of rosuvastatin-induced myopathy. In such cases, it may be recommended to prescribe a lower starting dose of rosuvastatin and adjust the dose based on disease-specific and specific population guidelines. If a higher dose is needed for desired efficacy, combination therapy may be considered.

However, it's important to note that these are general recommendations and the decision to adjust a statin prescription should also take into account other factors such as treatment goals, potential drug interactions, and the patient's overall health status. Consultation with a clinical pharmacist or other healthcare professional is advised for more personalized recommendations.

Question: How do variations in the CYP2C9 gene affect the metabolism of statins, and what are the implications for patients with different genotypes?

Answer: The CYP2C9 gene encodes an enzyme that is involved in the metabolism of various drugs, including certain statins. Variations in this gene can lead to different metabolizer phenotypes, which can affect how individuals respond to these medications.

Patients with a CYP2C9 Normal Metabolizer phenotype, such as those with the *1/*1, *1/*9, or *9/*9 diplotypes, have an activity score of 2.0. These individuals are categorized as Normal/Routine/Low Risk in their EHR notation, suggesting that they metabolize certain statins normally and are at a lower risk of adverse drug reactions or therapeutic failure due to genetic factors related to CYP2C9.

On the other hand, patients with a CYP2C9 Intermediate Metabolizer phenotype, such as those with the *9/*28, *9/*26, *9/*31, *9/*14, *9/*29, *9/*44, *9/*16, *9/*11, *9/*45, *1/*33, *1/*26, or *1/*8 diplotypes, have an activity score of 1.5 or 1.0. These individuals are categorized as Abnormal/Priority/High Risk in their EHR notation, suggesting that they metabolize certain statins less efficiently and may be at a higher risk of adverse drug reactions or therapeutic failure due to genetic factors related to CYP2C9.

However, it's important to note that these are general observations and the actual response to statins can be influenced by many factors, including other genetic factors, drug interactions, and individual patient characteristics. Therefore, patients should always consult with their healthcare provider for personalized advice regarding medication use.

Question: Are there any established clinical protocols for adjusting statin therapy based on pharmacogenomic test results, specifically focusing on SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 genotypes?

Answer: Yes, there are established clinical protocols for adjusting statin therapy based on pharmacogenomic test results, specifically focusing on SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 genotypes. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) has published guidelines on this topic. 

According to these guidelines, for patients who are candidates for new statin therapy, pharmacogenetic test results may provide additional useful information. For patients currently prescribed statin therapy, depending on how long the patient has been tolerating the statin, pharmacogenetic test results may be used as the basis for changing to another statin type or dose. However, statin therapy should neither be discontinued nor avoided based on SLCO1B1, ABCG2, or CYP2C9 genotype results for patients with an indication for statin therapy, especially if the statin therapy is based on the shared decision making between patient and provider.

The guidelines also suggest that preemptive SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 testing may potentially reduce the incidence of statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMS), by identifying those at significant risk and recommending a lower statin dose or an alternative statin with lower SAMS risk.

However, it's important to note that these guidelines are intended to provide information to assist in treatment decisions and not to replace clinical judgment. All treatment decisions should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, considering the unique circumstances of each patient.

To incorporate a phenotype in the EHR in a standardized manner, genotype test results provided by the laboratory must be consistently translated into an interpreted phenotype (Table 1, main manuscript).  Because clinicians must be able to easily find the information, the interpreted phenotype may be documented as a problem list entry or in a patient summary section; these phenotypes are best stored in the EHR at the “person level” rather than at the date-centric “encounter level”.

Question: How do the phenotypes of SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 impact the risk of adverse reactions to statins, and are there specific guidelines for managing this risk based on individual patient phenotypes?

Answer: The SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 genes play significant roles in the metabolism and transport of statins, which are medications commonly used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Variations in these genes can influence how an individual responds to statin therapy, including the risk of adverse reactions.

SLCO1B1 encodes a transporter protein that facilitates the hepatic uptake of all statins. Genetic variations in SLCO1B1 can increase systemic exposure to statins, which may increase the risk for statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMS). 

ABCG2 encodes an efflux transporter that modulates the absorption and disposition of rosuvastatin. Variations in this gene can also alter systemic exposure to rosuvastatin, potentially affecting the risk for SAMS.

CYP2C9 encodes a phase I drug metabolizing enzyme responsible for the oxidation of some statins. Genetic variations in CYP2C9 can alter the metabolism of these statins, potentially affecting both their efficacy and the risk of adverse effects.

The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) provides guidelines for prescribing statins based on SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 genotypes. These guidelines aim to improve the overall safety, adherence, and effectiveness of statin therapy by tailoring treatment to individual patient genotypes. However, it's important to note that these guidelines should be used in conjunction with other clinical information and considerations, such as treatment goals, potential drug interactions, and patient characteristics.

Question: Can you explain the significance of pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing in relation to the SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 genes for patients prescribed statins?

Answer: Pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing for the SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 genes can provide valuable information about a patient's potential response to statin therapy. These genes are involved in the metabolism and transport of statins, which are commonly prescribed medications for lowering cholesterol levels.

SLCO1B1 encodes a transporter protein that facilitates the hepatic uptake of all statins. Variations in this gene can alter systemic exposure to statins, potentially increasing the risk for statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMS).

ABCG2 encodes an efflux transporter protein that modulates the absorption and disposition of rosuvastatin, a specific type of statin. Genetic variations in ABCG2 can also alter systemic exposure to rosuvastatin, potentially affecting its effectiveness and safety.

CYP2C9 encodes a phase I drug metabolizing enzyme responsible for the oxidation of some statins. Variations in this gene can affect the metabolism of these statins, potentially leading to altered drug exposure and an increased risk for adverse events.

By identifying patients who have significant genetic risk factors for SAMS, PGx testing may help healthcare providers make more informed decisions about statin therapy. This could involve recommending a lower statin dose or an alternative statin with a lower risk of SAMS for these patients. However, it's important to note that while PGx testing can provide valuable information, it's just one factor to consider in the overall clinical picture. Other factors such as treatment goals, potential drug interactions, and patient preferences should also be considered when making prescribing decisions.

Question: How does the presence of variants in the SLCO1B1 gene impact the pharmacokinetics of statins, and what are the implications for patient care?

Answer: The SLCO1B1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in the uptake of certain drugs, including statins, into the liver. Variants in this gene can affect the function of this protein and thus influence the pharmacokinetics of statins. 

For instance, the SLCO1B1*5 allele (c.521T>C, rs4149056) is associated with decreased transport function, leading to higher plasma concentrations of statins and potentially increasing the risk of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). This is particularly relevant for simvastatin, but also for other statins. 

The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) provides guidelines for prescribing statins based on SLCO1B1 genotypes. For example, for patients with an SLCO1B1*1/*5 or *5/*5 genotype, a lower dose of simvastatin or an alternative statin may be considered to reduce the risk of SAMS.

However, it's important to note that the presence of SLCO1B1 variants is just one factor among many that can influence statin response and the occurrence of side effects. Other factors include the specific statin drug and dose, patient characteristics (such as age, sex, and overall health status), and the presence of other genetic variants, including those in the ABCG2 and CYP2C9 genes.

As an AI, I must emphasize that while this information can help guide treatment decisions, it should not be used in isolation. Healthcare professionals should consider all relevant factors when prescribing statins, and patients should consult their healthcare provider for personalized advice.

Question: What are the potential benefits of incorporating PGx testing for genes like SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 in the clinical management of patients on statin therapy?

Answer: Pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing for genes such as SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 can potentially benefit patients on statin therapy in several ways. One potential benefit is the reduction in the incidence of Statin-Associated Musculoskeletal Symptoms (SAMS). By identifying those at significant risk through PGx testing, healthcare providers can recommend a lower statin dose or an alternative statin with lower SAMS risk. 

Emerging data also suggest that PGx testing can improve patients' perceptions of statins and enhance appropriate statin prescribing. However, it's important to note that prospective data showing that prescribing based on genetic testing results alter SAMS incidence are currently lacking. 

It's also worth mentioning that genotyping errors could pose a risk, as genotypes are lifelong test results, and any such error could stay in the patient's record indefinitely. 

Please note that these potential benefits and risks should be considered in the context of each patient's unique clinical situation, and decisions about statin therapy should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.

Question: Are there any limitations or challenges associated with interpreting the results of PGx testing for SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 in the context of statin therapy?

Answer: Yes, there are several limitations and challenges associated with interpreting the results of pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing for SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 in the context of statin therapy. 

One potential challenge is the risk of genotyping errors. Since genotypes are lifelong test results, any error could persist in the patient's medical record and potentially impact future medical decisions. 

Another limitation is that while these genetic tests can provide useful information, they should not be the sole basis for making decisions about statin therapy. For patients currently prescribed statin therapy, depending on how long the patient has been tolerating the statin, pharmacogenetic test results may be used as the basis for changing to another statin type or dose. However, statin therapy should neither be discontinued nor avoided based on SLCO1B1, ABCG2, or CYP2C9 genotype results for patients with an indication for statin therapy, especially if the statin therapy is based on the shared decision making between patient and provider.

It's also important to note that while there is evidence linking genetic variation in SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 to statin-related phenotypes, the evidence is stronger for some associations than others. For example, the highest levels of evidence were found for SLCO1B1 (all statins), ABCG2 (rosuvastatin), and CYP2C9 (fluvastatin).

Finally, it's worth noting that the interpretation of PGx testing results can be complex and requires specialized knowledge. Therefore, it's recommended that healthcare providers who are not familiar with these tests consult with a clinical pharmacist or other expert in pharmacogenetics.

Question: How do the CPIC guidelines incorporate PGx testing results for SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 to provide therapeutic recommendations for statin use?

Answer: The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines provide therapeutic recommendations for statin use based on pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing results for SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 genotypes. These guidelines aim to optimize new or existing statin therapy to reduce the risk of statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMS). 

The guidelines suggest that for patients who are candidates for new statin therapy, pharmacogenetic test results may provide additional useful information. For patients currently prescribed statin therapy, depending on how long the patient has been tolerating the statin, pharmacogenetic test results may be used as the basis for changing to another statin type or dose. However, it is emphasized that statin therapy should neither be discontinued nor avoided based on SLCO1B1, ABCG2, or CYP2C9 genotype results for patients with an indication for statin therapy, especially if the statin therapy is based on the shared decision making between patient and provider.

The guidelines also highlight the importance of incorporating pharmacogenetic information into an Electronic Health Record (EHR) to optimize drug therapy. This includes documenting pharmacogenetic results, an interpreted phenotype, and a concise interpretation or summary of the result in the EHR. The interpreted phenotype may be documented as a problem list entry or in a patient summary section, and these phenotypes are best stored in the EHR at the “person level” rather than at the date-centric “encounter level”.

To incorporate a phenotype in the EHR in a standardized manner, genotype test results provided by the laboratory must be consistently translated into an interpreted phenotype (Table 1, main manuscript).  Because clinicians must be able to easily find the information, the interpreted phenotype may be documented as a problem list entry or in a patient summary section; these phenotypes are best stored in the EHR at the “person level” rather than at the date-centric “encounter level”.

Question: Can you describe the role of the ABCG2 gene in the absorption and disposition of statins, particularly rosuvastatin, and how variations in this gene can affect patient responses to the medication?

Answer: The ABCG2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. These proteins are involved in the transport of various molecules across cell membranes. In the context of statins, particularly rosuvastatin, the ABCG2 protein plays a significant role in the drug's disposition.

Variations in the ABCG2 gene can affect the function of the ABCG2 protein, which in turn can influence the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin. For instance, the rs2231142 variant (c.421C>A) in the ABCG2 gene has been associated with decreased function of the ABCG2 protein. This can lead to increased exposure to rosuvastatin, as the drug is not efficiently transported out of the cells. This increased exposure has been associated with improved cholesterol-lowering response to rosuvastatin in some studies.

However, it's important to note that the impact of ABCG2 variations on rosuvastatin response can be influenced by other factors, including other genetic variations and patient-specific factors. Therefore, the presence of an ABCG2 variant alone may not fully predict a patient's response to rosuvastatin.

Question: How do variations in the CYP2C9 gene affect the metabolism of specific statins, and what considerations should be made when prescribing statins to individuals with these variations?

Answer: Variations in the CYP2C9 gene can affect the metabolism of certain statins, including fluvastatin. The CYP2C9 enzyme is responsible for metabolizing fluvastatin, and genetic variations can alter the activity of this enzyme, leading to changes in drug exposure. For instance, individuals with CYP2C9*2 or CYP2C9*3 alleles, which result in decreased or no function of the enzyme, may have increased exposure to fluvastatin, potentially leading to an increased risk of adverse effects such as myopathy or liver toxicity.

When prescribing statins to individuals with these variations, it's important to consider the potential for increased risk of adverse effects. For fluvastatin, individuals identified as CYP2C9 intermediate metabolizers (IMs) should avoid doses greater than 40 mg, while poor metabolizers (PMs) should avoid doses greater than 20 mg. If higher doses are required for desired efficacy, an alternative statin should be considered. 

However, it's important to note that the evidence supporting increased risk of myopathy in carriers of decreased or poor function alleles of CYP2C9 is of moderate quality and mainly based on pharmacokinetic evidence. Genetic variation in CYP2C9 has not been associated with fluvastatin lipid-lowering response.

Please note that this information should be used as a guide, and the prescribing healthcare professional should consider all factors, including treatment goals and potential drug interactions, when making prescribing decisions.

Question: How can healthcare providers utilize the information obtained from PGx testing of the ABCG2, SLCO1B1, and CYP2C9 genes to optimize statin therapy and minimize adverse effects?

Answer: Pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing of the ABCG2, SLCO1B1, and CYP2C9 genes can provide valuable information to healthcare providers about a patient's potential response to statin therapy. These genes are involved in the metabolism and transport of statins, and variations in these genes can influence the effectiveness and tolerability of these medications.

For instance, the SLCO1B1 gene encodes a protein that transports statins into liver cells for metabolism. Variations in this gene can affect the rate at which statins are transported and metabolized, potentially leading to higher levels of the drug in the bloodstream and an increased risk of statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMS). Similarly, the ABCG2 gene encodes a protein that helps to transport certain statins out of cells, and variations in this gene can also affect statin levels in the body.

The CYP2C9 gene is involved in the metabolism of certain statins, and variations in this gene can affect how quickly these drugs are broken down in the body. This can influence the drug's effectiveness and the risk of side effects.

By considering a patient's PGx test results, healthcare providers can make more informed decisions about which statin to prescribe, and at what dose, to optimize efficacy and minimize the risk of adverse effects. For example, a patient with certain SLCO1B1 or ABCG2 variants might be prescribed a lower dose of a statin, or a different statin altogether, to reduce the risk of SAMS. Similarly, a patient with certain CYP2C9 variants might require a dose adjustment to ensure effective treatment.

However, it's important to note that PGx testing is just one tool that can help guide statin therapy. Healthcare providers should also consider other factors, such as a patient's overall health, other medications they are taking, and their treatment goals, when deciding on the best approach to statin therapy.

Because clinicians must be able to easily find the information, the interpreted phenotype may be documented as a problem list entry or in a patient summary section; these phenotypes are best stored in the EHR at the “person level” rather than at the date-centric “encounter level”.  Additionally, results should be entered as standardized and discrete terms to facilitate using them to provide point-of-care CDS (69, 76).
