I'm planning to travel abroad. Are there any considerations I should be aware of regarding my statin medication and travel?
I take Reditrex for my rheumatoid arthritis. My doctor has prescribed Crestor for my cholesterol. I am worried that there is some association between my arthritis and cholesterol drugs, what should I do?
I heard that I should avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice as I am taking Lipitor, is this true? I love grapefruit, will getting a genetic test help me find another cholesterol drug that will not interact with grapefruit? Can you also tell me what your sources are for this information?
I take Crestor for my cholesterol, and my husband and I are planning on having a baby. Can I continue taking Crestor during my pregnancy?
My friend mentioned that red yeast rice can be a natural alternative to statins. Is this true?
I've been experiencing hair loss recently. Could this be related to my statin medication?
