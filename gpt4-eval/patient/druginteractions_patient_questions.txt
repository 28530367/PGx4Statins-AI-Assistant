I got my genetic test results today, and it says that I have SLCO1B1 poor function. What does this mean for my Zocor prescription?
My test result shows an SLCO1B1 diplotype of *1/*17. What does this mean?
I am of Indian ethnicity with a family history of diabetes. My genetic test results indicate a rs4149056 variant. Will this impact my usage of statins? Does my ethnicity factor in some way?
My test result shows “CYP2C9 intermediate metabolizer and to have SLCO1B1 poor function”. My doctor wants to prescribe a completely different medicine now. What is happening?
I take Crestor. My doctor thinks my risk of heart disease is high and did a genetic test before she can increase my dose. My test result shows “ABCG2 decreased function and SLCO1B1 poor function”. She wants to now prescribe a completely different medicine! What is happening? She was in a hurry and did not explain well.
I take Lescol XL. My doctor thinks my risk of heart disease is high and did a genetic test before she can increase my dose. My test result shows “ABCG2 decreased function and SLCO1B1 poor function”. She wants to now prescribe a completely different medicine! What is happening? She was in a hurry and did not explain well.
If my test shows I have a decreased function in the SLCO1B1 gene, how will it impact the type or dose of statin I can take?
I’m prescribed Zocor; can mutations in the CYP2C9 gene affect how I should be dosed?
My doctor is considering switching me from Crestor to Lescol XL, would my SLCO1B1 gene variation affect how I respond to these medications differently?
